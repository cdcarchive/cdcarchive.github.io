## HIV testing

HIV testing is the gateway to care for people who have HIV and to prevention services for people who don't have HIV. CDC recommends that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 get tested for HIV at least once as part of routine health care. People with certain risk factors should get tested at least once a year. A recent study found that transgender women have high rates of recent and lifetime HIV testing.

## HIV prevention

There are many HIV prevention strategies available, including condoms; pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP); post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP); as well as interventions focused on risk reduction; adherence to HIV medicine; linkage to, retention in, and re-engagement in care; structural approaches; and engagement in PrEP care. Additionally, for people with HIV, treatment provides substantial benefits for personal health and reduces HIV transmission to others. This is sometimes called HIV treatment as prevention.
